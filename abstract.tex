% todo more description about cb
\cb{}\citemain{} is a server centric web framework that 
keeps web applications' application and representation state on the server side.
It simplifies the development of web application by
eliminting the need to write client/server communication code.
It also provides the end users a continuous experience in between visits even across
multiple devices.
Previous work\citemain{} has a limitation that it can only support one process.
We present a new implementation of \cb{} that could be deployed to multiple processes
on multiple machines.
The new implementation expands the capacity of \cb{} to make it feasible to 
support real world applications.
Evaluation shows that the new implementation could support 
live chat application with over 1000 concurrent users on a eight core machine.
