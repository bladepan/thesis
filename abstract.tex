% todo more description about cb
\cb{}\citemain{} is a server centric web framework that simplifies development of web applications.
\cb{} eliminates the need to write client/server communication code and naturally preserves presentation state in between requests.
Previous work\citemain{} has shown that \cb{} is capable of supporting hundreds of clients using one processor.
However, as more clients come in, the latency for each client would reach to a point that the interaction experience becomes unbearable for everyone.
Besides, keeping \cb{} running on a single processor makes it hard to provide
isolation between virtual browsers,
like one cpu draining virtual browser would sinificantly slows down the performance of others.
To overcome these problems, we extended \cb{} to make it support multiple processes and multiple hosts. 
Evaluation shows that the new implementation scales linearly up to X servers.
