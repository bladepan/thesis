% todo more description about cb
\cb{}\citemain{} is a server centric web framework that simplifies development of web applications.
\cb{} eliminates the need to write client/server communication code and naturally preserves presentation state in between requests.
Previous work\citemain{} has shown that \cb{} is capable of supporting hundreds of clients using one processor.
However, as more clients come in, the latency for each client would reach to a point that the interaction experience is unbearable for everyone.
Besides, keeping \cb{} running on a single processor has 
other drawbacks, like one cpu draining virtual browser slows down the performance of others.
poor isolation between virtual browsers, fail-over
To overcome these problems, we extend \cb{} to make it support multiple processes and multiple hosts. 
Evaluation shows that the new implementation scales linearly up to X servers.
