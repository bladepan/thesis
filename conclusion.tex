\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclu}

This paper hopes to convince the reader that maintaining the rich presentation state 
of a web application server-side is not an outlandish idea, but rather has many potential
benefits, ranging from simplified application development, improved user experience, to
increased security.  There is strong interest,
primarily outside of academia, in the development of platforms that simplify cloud-based 
application development.

We have prototyped and extensively tested this approach, focusing on a scalable
multiprocess version of our \cb{} platform.
The key limitations we encountered were not aspects of systems architecture or design, 
but the overhead cost of running rich frameworks, primarily in terms of CPU time.  
As these costs shift with the further refinement of these frameworks, we expect that
the use of this approach become more realistic.
