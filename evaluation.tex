\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:eval}
We have wrote several web applications on top of \cb{} to test its
performance and scalability.
One application is click application,
it increments and prints a counter on HTML whenever the user clicks.
This application represents applications with simple user interactions and small amount of DOM elements.
Other applications are chat applications.
A user can join a chat room to chat with other people,
changes his nickname, send messages, view recent messages in the chat room.
Whenever the number of messages in a chat room reaches 100, the first 50 messages
are discarded.
The chat applications represents more sophisticated applications.
We implemented the chat applications use popular web frameworks Angular and JQuery
to assess how \cb{} performs with real world web technology stack.

We implemented a benchmark tool to simulate multiple users.
Each simulated user sends HTTP requests the same way as
a web browser does when an actual user is interacting with a web application.
In the benchmarks, each simulated user will wait for its action taking effect before 
sending the next one.
For example, in the click application, the client will wait for the counter
to be refreshed before clicking again.
In the chat application, the client will wait for
the chat message appearing on the chat window before sending another one.
To be efficient, the simulated user does not render the view, 
it just analyzes server's response message to see if its action has been processed by
the server.
For example, after processing a chat message, 
the chat application will create a new DIV element with the chat message content, 
the simulated user will know a chat message is processed after it received
the corresponding DOM update message.
% TBD

The \cb{} system is deployed on a server with 8 Intel 2.27GHz cores and 12G memory.
The benchmark tool is deployed on a separate machine.

\subsection{Click Application}
In this benchmark,
we allocate a separate virtual browser for each client,
a client will click on the page, then wait for the counter to be refreshed and click again.

\subsection{Chat Applications}
For chat applications, 


\subsubsection{Angular Chat Application}
In this benchmark,
every 5 clients will share a chat room, 
after join the chat room, the client will change its nickname,
after that the client will start send messages.
The client will wait for each action takes effect to start the next one.
For example, the client will wait for his previous message rendered on the chat window before
sending the next one.
