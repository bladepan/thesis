\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:eval}
We have wrote several web applications on top of \cb{} to test its
performance and scalability.
One application is called click application,
it increments and prints a counter on HTML whenever the user clicks.
This application represents applications with simple user interactions and small amount of DOM elements.
Other applications are chat applications.
A user can join a chat room to chat with other people,
changes his nickname, send messages, view the most recent 50 to 100 messages in the chat room.
The chat applications represents more sophisticated applications.
We implemented the chat applications use popular web frameworks Angular and Ember.

We also implement a benchmark tool to simulate multiple users.
The benchmark tool will send HTTP requests to mimic the bootstrapping process of a real client,
and send web socket message to \cb{} to simulate user interaction with the application.
Those messages are identical to those triggered by real user events like mouse click and key stroke.

The \cb{} system is deployed on a server with 8 Intel 2.27GHz cores and 12G memory.
The benchmark tool is deployed on a separate machine.

\subsection{Click Application}
In this benchmark,
we allocate a separate virtual browser for each client,
a client will click on the page, then wait for the counter to be refreshed and click again.
