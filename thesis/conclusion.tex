\section{Future Work}
The upcoming \js standard brings a lot of promising features. 
One of the new language feature in ECMAScript 7 proposal is native
support for observing changes to objects~\cite{jsobserveprop}.
A evaluation shows that dirty checking in Angular.js becomes
20 to 40 times faster using this feature~\cite{angularjsspeedup}.
We could also design new APIs in application instance to provide
notifications of changes to share objects based on this feature.
We will investigate new opportunities brought by language updates
like such to further improve our framework.
