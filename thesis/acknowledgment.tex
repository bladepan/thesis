\markright{Acknowledgments}

I am very fortunate to have Dr. Godmar Back as my advisor.  I would like to
thank him for his patience and guidance. I am very grateful for the time and
effort he put in our weekly one-to-one meetings. These meetings are
at least equivalent to three graduate courses.

I would also like to thank Dr. Ali R. Butt and Dr. Eli Tilevich for serving
on my committee and providing valuable feedbacks.

I would also like to thank my fellow graduate students in computer science
department, it is a honor to spend two years with you wonderful guys.

Finally, I would like to thank National Science Foundation.
