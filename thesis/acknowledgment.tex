I am very fortunate to have Dr. Godmar Back as my advisor. He is always patient,
even for dumb questions. 
He is strict for every detail, but in the same time gives me enough freedom
to make my own decisions.
He inspires me to be a better engineer and researcher with his great passion for
technology and innovation, and his unparalleled professionalism. 


I would also like to thank Dr. Ali R. Butt and  Dr. Eli Tilevich for serving in my
committee and providing valuable feedbacks.

Finally, I would like to thank my fellow graduate students in computer science department,
it is a honor to spend two years with you wonderful guys.
