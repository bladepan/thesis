% http://www.google.com/patents/US20010047477
% idea about use a central database to hold session data, support multiple 
% web application instances
% user and session management is made independent of the web application instance ... A user database is maintained by the central server which stores the session cookie and correlates it to a web application instance, identified by system variables stored in the database, rather than with application variables maintained by an application instance.
%The present invention achieves the above-mentioned advantages by creating multiple instances of a web application for multiple users in contrast to the traditional approach of creating a single instance of a web application for multiple users or creating a single instance of a web application for each individual web browser request. Furthermore, the present invention provides a server that generates and stores system variables relating to a user and a session to generate and track us of an application instance independent of the application, rather than having the application generate and track application variables which as is done in existing technologies. Furthermore, for each request from a user interacting simultaneously with multiple sessions, it is possible to maintain each application instance involved in the user's sessions rather than deleting a prior instance upon the receipt of each new request from the user.
