ItsNat~\cite{santamariaitsnat} is a server-centric framework that also adopts server side DOM tree
and has a similar client server DOM synchronization mechanism.
However, the application developers need to register event handlers using Java
language, thus they cannot use the existing client side \js{} libraries.
Moreover, to horizontally scale up, ItsNat introduces a stateless mode which
constructs the whole server side DOM tree for every client side request,
which could be expensive if the DOM tree is big.
Another option is to introduce a load balancer that 
keeps session affinity when distributes requests.
In our system, scaling up is handled transparently by the system.
